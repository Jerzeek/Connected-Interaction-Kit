It falls in between DIN A6 and A5 formats. As with the production of A6 booklets, the pages are printed on paper of the next-largest format (A5) and then cut to size; therefore, A6 Portrait must be selected when placing the order. Confirm the custom paper size with the printing service when placing the order.
