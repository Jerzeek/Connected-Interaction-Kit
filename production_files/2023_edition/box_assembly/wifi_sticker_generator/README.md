The folder [/QRCodes_Gen](QRCodes_Gen/) contains a [Processing](https://processing.org/download) sketch that creates a PDF print file for WiFi authentication token QR codes.

The sketch asks for a directory containing .png files with the individual codes. To test the functionality of the program, the included [/sample_data](sample_data/) directory may be selected when asked for a directory.

The printing can be done on any laser printer capable of printing on heavy paper. For the proportions to match those of the individual stickers, it is recommended to use Adobe Acrobat with and select a custom scaling factor of 100% in the print settings dialogue.
