The files are optimized for lasercutting as much as possible, 10 inlays fitting one cardboard sheet. 35 sheets per file results in 350 sets of inlays.

To facilitate assembly, the lowest layer is marked with a small B, and the mid-layer with an M in the bottom right corner. The topmost layer has no marking.
