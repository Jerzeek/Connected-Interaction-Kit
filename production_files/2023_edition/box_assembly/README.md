## Box Branding

![Closed box](/assets/connected-interaction-kit-2023-box.jpg)

The branding of the box is composed of two labels: 

The square primary label is to be placed in the bottom-left corner of the box and features the name of the kit, the branding pattern of the kit ecosystem, and a place for students to note their name and student number. 

The round secondary sticker is to be placed on the top edge of the square sticker with a slight offset. It denotes the kit edition and provides a distinctive look. Additionally, these stickers may be used to cover up regulatory and production markings that were present on several box lids.

The font used is [Ubuntu Mono Bold](https://design.ubuntu.com/font); the pattern was generated using the [cover_pattern_generator](/production_files/2023_edition/booklet/cover_pattern_generator/).


## Box Inlays

The box inlays present the kit's main components neatly and comprehensibly and facilitate the organization and storage of the kit contents. A bottom paper inlay features component labels, whereas three layers of laser-cut cardboard are used to create individual storage compartments.

- Printer


### Component Labels

The [/labeled_inlay](labeled_inlay/) directory contains a ready-to-use [print file](labeled_inlay/print_file.pdf) and an InDesign file that can be used to customize the component labels.

The printing can be done on any laser printer capable of printing on 120g heavy paper. For the proportions to match those of the cardboard inlays, it is recommended to use Adobe Acrobat and select a custom scaling factor of 100% in the print settings dialogue.

For the Xerox printers found around the TU Delft campus, the following settings are recommended:

1. *Copies: 50 (for easier batching)*
2. *Page Sizing & Handling > Size >* ***100%\*** *or* ***Actual size\*** *(ensures proper positioning and sizing of elements)* 
3. *Printer > Paper Feed >* ***Tray 5 (Bypass)\*** *(make sure to pre-load the unbleached paper into the tray)*
4. *Printer > Xerox Features > 2-Sided Print >* ***1-Sided-Print\***
5. *Print*

Remember to add the unbleached paper to the printer's bypass (tray 5) before starting the job. The bypass can handle ~50 pages at a time, so adding the job as a favorite in the menu may streamline the process. Alternatively, you can load the paper into a regular tray (e.g., tray 4) to print larger batches.
