# Connected Interaction Kit 

This online repository is part of the Connected Interaction Kit designed by students and teachers at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering of the TU Delft.

As a design student you have to learn many skills but you have limited time, you cannot be an expert in all. At the same time you want to feel confident when talking to peers and engineers about realising your vision of how technology should influence the daily life of people. With this kit you simply start to build this confidence.

The composition of this kit, the tools and the procedure you use to create technology experiences are carefully selected and tuned to your needs. It is easy to get started, some barriers existing in similar kits on the market are removed. At the same time, the kit is also versatile and extendable, it can grow with you as you build your skills and confidence.
With this kit you can create a great range of technology mediated experiences. You can create anything from a small wearable device to interactive architecture, from a simple interactive lamp on your desk to a connected system of lamps illuminating your friends all over the world.

Have fun and be curious while exploring.
