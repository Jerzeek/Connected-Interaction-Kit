# Connected Interaction Kit 

Hello, fellow prototyper!

As a design student, you are learning to navigate a diverse set of skills. While becoming an expert in every domain is nearly impossible, it is essential to understand a skill sufficiently well to talk about ideas, understand challenges and limitations, and communicate confidently with experts.

With this kit, you will develop the abilities and confidence needed to realize your vision of how technology should influence people's daily lives. 

The kit provides an easy and fun gateway to start creating a great range of technology-mediated experiences. It contains a versatile collection of tools and components for you to build on as you grow your skills and confidence.

Use your imagination to find out what you can create! Be it a wearable companion device, an interactive desk lamp, or an entire connected ecosystem that brings you closer to your friends around the globe - the sky is the limit!

Have fun and be curious!
