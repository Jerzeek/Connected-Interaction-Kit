# 01 Hello world â€“ Set up and let there be light

In order to make your prototypes behave, you need to create a program and store that on the ItsyBitsy. You need the following equipment to support this:
1. **ItsyBitsy + Expander:** You connect the ItsyBitsy and Expander to your computer with the USB cable in the box. Once a new program is saved to the ItsyBitsy that program will run. The ItsyBitsy will remember the last saved program even if you disconnect it from your computer.
2. **Your computer + program editor:** You create the program by writing instructions in a program editor.
Any text editor software on your computer will do but in this booklet we choose the `Mu Editor`. It originated in education and is open source software available as a free download. The `Mu Editor` also has some nifty features to support you in the process. It helps you to write the instructions correctly and helps you figure out what goes wrong. For sure it will go wrong and that is when you learn ðŸ˜‰
