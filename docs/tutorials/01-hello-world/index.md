# 01 Hello world â€“ Set up and let there be light

When working with electronics and building interactive prototypes there are some reoccurring, essential elements, and some optional components that can change each time.
Two essential elements for building prototypes with this kit are:
1. **ItsyBitsy + Expander board:** This will be the heart of all your prototypes. Once code is uploaded from your computer to the board, it will run and follow the given instructions even when disconnected from your computer.
2. **Your computer + code editor:** The ItsyBitsy micro controller itself will initially do nothing. In order to give our prototypes a logic and behaviour, we need to upload instructions via USB from our computer to the board and tell it what to do. This we can achieve a code editor. Our code editor of choice is called **MU,** and it packs in some nifty features that we will make use of later on.
