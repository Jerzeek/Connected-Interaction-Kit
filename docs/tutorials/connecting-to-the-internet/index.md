You can connect your ItsyBitsy to most Wifis, like your home network or even the internet hotspot of your smartphone.
In this tutorial, we will enable our ItsyBitsy to connect to an open `Application Programming Interface` (or also known as `API`), and print a random joke in our `Serial Monitor`.

Because of tight security regulations of the university, it is not possible to connect your ItsyBitsy Expander to the **eduroam** network directly. However, you can make use of the **TUD-facility** network to bring your device online, following the later steps of this tutorial!
