# Part 3 - Connect to a WiFi Network

To connect your ItsyBitsy to a network, you must provide a network name (SSID) and password. However, directly using sensitive data like WiFi passwords in your code is risky. Therefore, creating a separate file to hold your personal keys and passwords outside your `code.py` file is a good idea. This way, you can share your code without revealing sensitive data to others.

1. Begin by clicking the **`+`** icon labeled **New** in the top toolbar of Mu Editor.

2. Copy and paste the following code to the new file, replacing `network-name` with the name of your WiFi network and `network-passwd` with your network's password (or the iPSK generated during [part two](part-2) when connecting to TUD-facility).

```python
settings = {
    "ssid": "network-name",
    "password": "network-passwd"
}
```

3. Click the **Save** button in the toolbar and save the file on your `CIRCUITPY` drive using the name `settings.py`.

4. Enter your `code.py` file and replace the code you wrote in [part one](part-1) with the code below, then hit **Save**.

```python
import board
import busio
import time
import digitalio
from adafruit_esp32spi import adafruit_esp32spi

# Get WiFi details from your settings.py file
from settings import settings

# Define the pins used by the BitsyExpander's ESP32 WiFi module
esp32_cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D9)
esp32_ready = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D11)
esp32_reset = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D12)
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, board.MOSI, board.MISO)

# Initialize the ESP32 WiFi module
esp = adafruit_esp32spi.ESP_SPIcontrol(spi, esp32_cs, esp32_ready, esp32_reset)

if esp.status == adafruit_esp32spi.WL_IDLE_STATUS:
    print("\nESP32 WiFi Module found.")
    print("Firmware version:", str(esp.firmware_version, "utf-8"))
    print("*" * 40)

print("\nScanning for available networks...\n")
network_list = [str(ap["ssid"], "utf-8") for ap in esp.scan_networks()]    
if settings["ssid"] not in network_list:
    print(settings["ssid"], "not found.\nAvailable networks:", network_list) 
    raise SystemExit(0)
         
print(settings["ssid"], "found. Connecting...")
while not esp.is_connected:
    try:
        esp.connect_AP(settings["ssid"], settings["password"])
    except (RuntimeError, ConnectionError) as e:
        print("\nUnable to establish connection. Are you using a valid password?")
        print("Error message:", e, "\nRetrying...")
        continue
         
print("Connected! IP address:", esp.pretty_ip(esp.ip_address))
          
while True:
    print("\nPinging google.com...")
    response = esp.ping("google.com")
    print("Ping successful. Response time:", response, "ms")
    time.sleep(5)
```

5. Open Mu's `Serial Monitor` to verify that the microcontroller successfully connects to the chosen network and can get a response from `google.com`.

6. Note the differences from the code you encountered in [part one](part-1) of this tutorial:

      - An `import` statement for your newly created `settings.py` file has been added. This gives the code access to the network name (SSID) and password.
      - The network scan has been moved out of the `while True:` loop and is performed once before entering the loop.
      - The code verifies the network you configured is available and waits for the successful establishment of a connection.
      - The content of the `while True:` loop has been replaced: It now pings google.com and reports the response time. This confirms internet connectivity for your microcontroller.
