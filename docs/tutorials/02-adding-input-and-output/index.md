# 02 Adding Input and Output

In Tutorial 1 you changed the blink behaviour of your ItsyBitsy by changing the program. In this tutorial you will create a program with a complete interaction cycle, from “looking at” user actions to effecting changes in the behaviour - your first complete interactive prototype!

Your Connected Interaction Kit comes with a variety of components. Some can read the actions of a user (`inputs` or sensors) others can give feedback (`outputs` or actuators) to effect a change in behaviour of the prototype. Perhaps prompting the user to another action, causing different feedback, etc. Interaction is
a process that unfolds over time in a choreography between user and prototype.

The design of the interaction in this case is simple: when a user reaches for the Touch Sensor, the Vibration Motor starts vibrating. When the Touch Sensor is released, the Vibration Motor
stops vibrating.
