# 02 Connecting Components

In the previous tutorial we set up our computer and connected it to the ItsyBitsy to start with some simple code that made the internal LED of blink. 

The Connected Interaction Kit comes with a variety of components that you can use to craft experiences and add input as well as output to your prototype.

In this tutorial we will expand our scope and integrate two external components into our setup that allow us to interact with our written code. In the end we will have a setup that allows us to control a vibration motor with a simple touch.
