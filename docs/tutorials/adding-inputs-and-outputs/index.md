# Tutorial 3 - Adding Inputs and Outputs

In the previous tutorial, you changed the behavior of a blinking LED. Here, you will learn how to build and program your first complete interactive prototype.

You will use a sensor from your kit (an `INPUT` component) to detect an action performed by a user. Once detected, this will trigger a change in your prototype’s behavior. You will use an actuator (an `OUTPUT` component) to create this behavior. 

Designing this interaction provides a simple template for using the different component types in your kit. You will later be able to use this template to devise more intricate interaction choreographies.

This tutorial begins by walking you through using a [Touch Sensor](../../components/touch-sensor/touch-sensor) to register a user’s touch. Later, you will learn how to add a [Vibration Motor](../../components/vibration-motor/vibration-motor) to create vibrations for as long as the sensor is triggered.
