# Redirect

This page is here to retain compatibility with the original booklet, which used index numbers as part of the URL of the tutorial. The numbers have been dropped to improve the ease of maintaining this documentation with multiple kit editions.

This page will redirect traffic to the tutorial under the new URL scheme.
