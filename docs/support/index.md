# Getting help

## What do I do when hardware components are not working?
In case any of your components not working as expected, please check the [documentation page](../components/index) of the component first and try getting it running with the example code first.

Most issues can be fixed by double-checking the following:
1. Is your component connected to the right port of the Expander board?
2. Is your ItsyBitsy properly plugged into your computer?
3. Does an error message appear in MU's `Serial monitor`, indicating a software issue (e.g. typos, coding mistake, missing library, etc.)

If you checked the points above thoroughly and your component is still not working, you can find extra help at IO's [Model Making and Machine Lab (PMB)](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/faciliteiten/pmb).

## Where can I get more hardware components?
The Connected Interaction Kit can be extended with additional Grove components. Every Grove component should work.

You can get additional components at following places:
1. Left-over and used Grove components can be gathered from the [PMB](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/faciliteiten/pmb) for free
2. New Grove components can be bought at the [PMB](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/faciliteiten/pmb) for 1â‚¬ per piece
3. Depending on the course, components can be borrowed temporarily from IO's StudioLab and Applied Lab
4. Bought online, for instance at [Kiwi Electronics](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/en/home)


## Where can I get support for prototyping for courses?
Each course using the Connected Interaction Kit will have their own tech support that can guide and support you in learning prototyping.
