<h1 id="troubleshooting-steps-for-itsybitsy">Troubleshooting Steps for ItsyBitsy</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Is the ItsyBitsy powered/is the USB plugged in?
    <ol>
      <li>Are you using a micro USB data cable? some cables only supply power, not data.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Are you working in Mu editor?</li>
  <li>Are the sensors and actuators plugged into the correct ports?
    <ol>
      <li>If you’re using Chainable LEDs, are they connected to the IN side? (See the white arrow)</li>
      <li>Chainable LEDs don’t need to return to the board.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is the correct code saved on the ItsyBitsy? (Not locally on your laptop)
    <ol>
      <li>Does the file have the name “code.py”?</li>
      <li>Mu indicates where it saves it when you click save, at the very bottom left.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Have you clicked the reset button once? (button with “rst”)</li>
  <li>If you open the Serial monitor and save again, is there an error in the console?
    <ol>
      <li>If the error contains “Module”, check if all libraries are on the board.
        <ol>
          <li>You can find the libraries by googling “CircuitPython libraries” or download them from https://circuitpython.org/libraries.</li>
          <li>We’re using version 9.X</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the error contains “INDENT”, then there’s too much or too little TAB/(SPACE) somewhere. Usually at the beginning of a code line.</li>
      <li>If the error contains “SYNTAX”, there’s likely a missing “:” or a keyword (such as IF or Print) is mistyped/used incorrectly.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Are you in REPL mode (Do you see “»&gt;” in your console)? You can exit by typing “ctrl + d”, or a few times “ctrl + c” and then “ctrl + d”.</li>
  <li>Make sure you read what the code does and follow all steps.</li>
</ol>
