<p>In the previous tutorial, you changed the behavior of a blinking LED. Here, you will learn how to build and program your first complete interactive prototype.</p>

<p>You will use a sensor from your kit (an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INPUT</code> component) to detect an action performed by a user. Once detected, this will trigger a change in your prototype’s behavior. You will use an actuator (an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OUTPUT</code> component) to create this behavior.</p>

<p>Designing this interaction provides a simple template for using the different component types in your kit. You will later be able to use this template to devise more intricate interaction choreographies.</p>

<p>This tutorial begins by walking you through using a <a href="../../components/touch-sensor/touch-sensor">Touch Sensor</a> to register a user’s touch. Later, you will learn how to add a <a href="../../components/vibration-motor/vibration-motor">Vibration Motor</a> to create vibrations for as long as the sensor is triggered.</p>
