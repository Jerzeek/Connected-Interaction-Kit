<p>Once your microcontroller has power, the pre-loaded code should make the onboard LED blink. To see the code and start making modifications, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using the USB cable included in the kit, connect the ItsyBitsy to your computer. It will appear in your computerâ€™s file manager as a storage device called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CIRCUITPY</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open Mu Editor. Click the Load button in the toolbar at the top of the program window and navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CIRCUITPY</code> drive. Find the file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code.py</code> and open it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your microcontroller will execute any code stored in that file. Briefly examine the example code and see if you understand some parts. In the next step, we will take a closer look at how it works and how to tweak it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">Once you store changes in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code.py</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CIRCUITPY</code> drive, your ItsyBitsy will begin running the new code immediately. Changes will persist even after disconnecting the ItsyBitsy from your computer.</p>
