<p>You can use your BitsyExpander to connect your ItsyBitsy microcontroller to most WiFi networks, such as your home network or your smartphone’s mobile hotspot.</p>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through connecting your ItsyBitsy microcontroller to a local WiFi network, retrieving a random joke from the internet using an <a href="../../glossary/glossary">API</a> (Application Programming Interface), and displaying it on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Serial Monitor</code>.</p>

<p class="note">Connecting your microcontroller to <strong>eduroam</strong> is cumbersome due to strict security measures. If you are on campus, follow the steps provided later in this tutorial to connect your device to the internet using the <strong>TUD-facility</strong> network instead. This wifi is created for all kinds of small computers (eg. microcontrollers and raspberry pi’s). Security is enforced by allowing students to connect a small computer that is linked to their netid.</p>
