<h1 id="part-2---register-your-device-for-use-on-campus">Part 2 - Register Your Device for Use on Campus</h1>

<p class="important">This step must be performed before you connect your microcontroller to the internet on campus for the first time. If you completed this step before or are using a personal network (e.g., your home network or your phone’s mobile hotspot), you can <a href="part-3">skip this step</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, security measures on campus prevent your microcontroller from using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eduroam</code> network. To access the internet, you will need to connect it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUD-facility</code> instead. To do so, you must first register your device’s <a href="../../glossary/glossary">MAC address</a> with your NetID.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using your smartphone’s camera app, scan your personal access token (the QR code in the lid of the box of your Connected Interaction Kit) and log in with your NetID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You find yourself at a screen where you should announce yourself to this system by pressing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claim license</code> button. For each device you register in the next steps, TU Delft ICT can now find the responsible person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Register devices</code> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the MAC address you identified for your Expander Board in <a href="part-1">part one of this tutorial</a>, and choose a name for your device.</p>

    <p><img src="assets/register_address.jpg" alt="MAC address registration" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tap the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Register MAC Address</code> button and confirm. A new section for the device you registered will appear under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Registered Devices</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iPSK</code> and write it down or save it. It will serve as the password to connect to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUD-facility</code> WiFi network in the following step.</p>

    <p><img src="assets/registered_devices.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the submitted form with iPSK string" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">You can register up to three devices using your personal access token (QR code). Please note that <strong>the MAC address is associated with the Expander Board</strong>, not the ItsyBitsy Microcontroller. If you change Expander boards or want to use other devices on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TUD-facility</code>, you must repeat these steps to link their MAC addresses to your token.</p>
