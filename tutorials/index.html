<p>Welcome to the tutorials section of the Connected Interaction Kit!</p>

<p>Here, you will find a comprehensive set of tutorials aimed at helping you take your first steps in working with microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. We included easy-to-follow instructions covering everything from setting up the tools needed to use your microcontroller to creating your first interaction and writing your first program.</p>

<p>The tutorials below are partly also written up in the physical booklet included in the kit. <a href="https://github.com/id-studiolab/Connected-Interaction-Kit/blob/main/production_files/2024_edidion%20%28wip%29/booklet/2024_Kit_Booklet%28RGB_Digital_Publishing%29.pdf">The PDF version of that booklet is available in our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
