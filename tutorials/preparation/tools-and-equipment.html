<p>These are the tools and equipment you need to get started:</p>

<h3 id="itsybitsy--expander">ItsyBitsy + Expander</h3>
<p>The ItsyBitsy microcontroller and its Expander form the hardware platform you will be using. When connected to your computer using the included USB data cable, the ItsyBitsy will appear as a storage device called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CIRCUITPY</code>.</p>

<h3 id="your-computer--mu-editor">Your Computer + Mu Editor</h3>
<p>You could, in theory, use any text editor to write programs for your microcontroller. In practice, you should always use a code editor, as it will simplify things greatly. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mu Editor</code> is free, open-source, and great for beginners. It spots errors, highlights important code passages, and helps structure your program. It has excellent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CircuitPython</code> support and offers important features for working with microcontrollers.</p>
