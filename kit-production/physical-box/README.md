## Overview of ordered material
| Name | Ordered amount | Explanatory note | Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cardboard Box (A5, 50mm)](link) | 22 packs (20 boxes each)  | Boxes for the kit, ordered at [Pressel.com](https://www.pressel.com/p/pressel-klappdeckel-boxen-a5-220x157x50mm-braun-20-stuck/90401?SearchTerm=90401) and due to limited stock at also at [Kantoorartikelen.nl](https://www.kantoorartikelen.nl/p/1569130/pressel-klapdekseldoos-a5-220-x-157-x-50mm-bruin-pak-20-stuks-).  | Good looking and affordable boxes, but propably better to go for a two-piece box like [this one](https://www.pressel.com/p/pressel-stulpdeckel-karton-braun-220x151x44mm/90503) to have no flaps on the inside of the box that interfere with the inlay and content. Even better if these boxes can be printed on at the factory alreadt to save some manufacturing hassle |
| [Cardboard Sheets (1170x770)](https://www.pressel.com/p/pressel-karton-zwischenlagen-2-wellig-1170x770mm/830801?SearchTerm=830801) | 60 | Used as a basis to lasercut the box inlays |  There is [another version](https://www.pressel.com/p/pressel-karton-zwischenlagen-1-wellig-1170x770mm/830800?tracking=searchterm:1170x770mm) with only 1 layer of corrugated cardboard which might be more suited for the inlay to keep it flatter and the stacked components easier to remove |
| [Kraftpapier A4 120g](https://discountoffice.nl/p/kraftpapier-folia-din-a4-120gr/) | 5 packs (100 sheets each) | Used to print on component names before gluing it the inlay | The paper has a nice color that matches the boxes closely. Cutting out ~A5 paper from the A4 sheets led to some waste, but the inlay design was unfortunately bigger than exaclty A5 (210x148mm) |
| [Bruna label paper](https://www.bruna.nl/kantoor/etiket-bruna-105x37mm-240stuks-796398) | 2 packs (16 sheets / 240 stickers each) | Used to print the QR code stickers on | / |
| Spray Glue | 6-8 bottles | Used to fuse together the three inlay pieces | We needed way more glue than anticipated. Also, **not all glue is equal**! Either go for HEMA spray glue or [Bison Lijmspray](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/bison-lijmspray-spuitbus-transparant-500-ml/p/B484020), as the cheaper [Handson spray](https://www.gamma.nl/assortiment/handson-lijmspray-spuitbus-400-ml/p/B604459) was way to concentrated in its spray beam, which led to blotchy paper and more glue usage than needed |
| [Laser rubber](https://www.kopierladen-berlin.de/lasergummi-fuer-lasergravurmaschinen.html) | 1 sheet | Used to engrave the branding on and stemp it on the boxes | The engraving of the sheet went alright, but the stamping procedure was rather medicore in success with very inconcistent results. Recommendation for the next edition is to either go for glued stickers (although perhaps not as nice looking), pre-printed box (might be more expensive), or [literally adding branding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNePStOW2g0) |
| [Stamp Pillow](https://www.bol.com/nl/account/bestellingen/details.html?placedOrderId=1317253311#1763440826) | 1 | The ink needed for the branding process | This ink was used as it is waterproof and does not lead to unwanted issues in case the student's box gets wet |
| [A5 Booklets](https://www.pixartprinting.nl/printen-tijdschriften-boeken-catalogi/met-nietjes-gebonden/) | 400 normal + 400 recycled paper | Introduction booklet in the box | *to be added* |
